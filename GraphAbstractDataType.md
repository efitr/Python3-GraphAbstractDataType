# This is the creation of a Graph Abstract Data Type 
## Available in two datastructures:
* Adjacency Matrix
* Adjacency List

## Comparison in and outs of choosing either structure:
* Memory Wise - **Adjacency List** is **better** at been less expensive for the memory. Because we only need to store the values for the vertex. 
* Edge Lookup - **Abjacency Matrix** is **better** at checking if between vertex A and B exists an edge.
